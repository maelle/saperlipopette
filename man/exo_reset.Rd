\description{
I am working in a feature branch that's all my own.
I made many small commits as I was figuring things out.
Now I want the commits to tell a story for the PR reviewers,
and not a story of how many stupid mistakes I made!
Instead of \verb{git base --interactive} also available as \verb{git rebase -i}.ยก,
I can also use \verb{git reset --mixed} and then build the commits.
